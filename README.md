# Pitch
## Problem Pain
Food insecurity is experienced by workers when they stop working due to illnesses or injuries. When working at construction sites, accidents are bound to happen. However, when employers dodge responsibility in paying medical leave, workers are left cash-strapped for food and unsure of how to deal with the situation.

In the case of Muthusamy Kasinathan, who after injuring his hand, had his employers simply brush it off and asked him to continue working.

Though thankfully for him, he was able to go to the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and after engaging a lawyer he secured his wages and received the appropriate treatment.

Unfortunately not all workers are as lucky as him to have a lawyer, and even Kasinathan himself admitted that he didnâ€™t fully know all his rights.


## Solution
Ladies and gentlemen introducing our online forum Burden Brothers we aim to target the root cause of the problem with 3 main steps: OLE.

### O is for Outreach
Unsure and unaware migrant workers can find our safe space in the form of a chat group, helpline, and direct message where they can express their concerns.

### L is for Lifebuoy
Our lifebuoy bot spots workers at risk who are hesitant to seek help and recommends them to organisations like Healthserve, TWC2 and MOM while also informing relevant information to the organizations.

### E is for Empowerment
Migrant workers can go on to read further about their rights, stories of other migrant workers like Kasinathan as well as have discussions on our online forums with migrant workers that have returned to their home country to further encourage reinforcement between workers and give hope to those in their tough situation.

## Market
Now, in order to launch our idea we believe that development is not too costly but acquiring human resources, marketing and connections will be more challenging.

So we hope to appeal to VWOs like Healthcare and TWC2 by helping them expand their outreach and educating workers on their rights and partner and partner up with them as well as take advantage of grants to secure funding.
